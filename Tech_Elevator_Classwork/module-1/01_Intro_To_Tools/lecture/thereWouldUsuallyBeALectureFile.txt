Hi! Normally you would have some lecture code in here so that you can follow along on your computer if you want!
But on the first day we don't have that.

At the end of lecture, I will push up the code that we wrote AS A CLASS in another folder,
called lecture-in-class

additionally, sometimes if I feel that our in-class code differed greatly from the 
way that they did things in the curriculum, I might give you yet another version of the code
that one is in a colder called lecture-final.

At the end of class, I will also push up today's exercise folder, and the tutorial folders for the 
next unit.

This will generally result in any particular unit having 5-6 folders in it once we are done:
exercise
lecture
(sometimes) lecture-final
lecture-in-class
tutorial
tutorial-final

the places in here where you will write your own code include the "exercise" folder, the "lecture" folder, and the "tutorial" folder.

The rest are for reference.
