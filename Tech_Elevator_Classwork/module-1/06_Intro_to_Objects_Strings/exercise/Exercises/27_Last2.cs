        Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring length 2 appears in the string and
        also as the last 2 chars of the string.

        We don't count the end subString, so "hixxxhi" yields 1, but the subString may overlap a prior position by one.
        For instance, "xxxx" has a count of 2: one pair at position 0, and the second at position 1. The third pair at
        position 2 is the end subString, which we don't count

        Last2("hixxhi") → 1
        Last2("xaxxaxaxx") → 1
        Last2("axxxaaxx") → 2
        Last2("xxxx") -> 2
