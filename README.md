# Hello, human beings!
I'm Trevor, and I am a sort-of-brand-new software developer. To elaborate, I was a math teacher for 16 years, seven (?) of which I also taught computer science classes. I did not go to school for computer science, so those first couple/few years I was learning to code right along with the students. I only taught the foundational stuff (using Python and Java), so that is the extent of my programming knowledge...for now. That will change drastically by the middle of December as I make my way through the Tech Elevator bootcamp ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

I love cats (and dogs, but my wife and I don't have any yet), I have an unhealthy relationship with ice cream and candy, and I draw my smiley faces with noses. Apparently that's weird :-)
