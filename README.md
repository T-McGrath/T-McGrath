# Hello, human beings!
I'm Trevor, and I am sort-of-new to the programming realm. To elaborate, I was a math teacher for 16 years, seven of which I also taught computer science classes. I did not go to school for computer science, so those first couple/few years I was learning to code right along with the students. I only taught the foundational stuff (using Python and Java), but I LOVED it, so when I realized I needed a career change, I knew the path I had to take. Scoot ahead a bit, and now I'm wrapping up work at a programming bootcamp called Tech Elevator. My time here so far has been a m a z i n g, and I can't wait to get into the workforce as a progammer!

I love cats (and dogs, but my wife and I don't have any yet), I have an unhealthy relationship with ice cream and candy, and I draw my smiley faces with noses. People tell me that's weird, and to them I respond, :-)
